                    <h3>ANXIETY</h3>
                        <p class="tips">Walking in nature is a great way to relieve stress and calm the mind, many of us struggle with stress, difficult thoughts, depression or feeling overwhelmed often trapped in our heads sometimes so a small walk on your own, with friends or a pet does help you get out in the fresh air any time of day.</p>
                        <p class="tips">In the moments of walking this enables us to focus on the things around us on the walk like the colour of the leaves, the sounds of birds and the colours of the sky sometimes a morning walk before you start the day is great, waking up and being greeted by the suns warmth or during the day with the rain hitting off your jacket no matter the weather.</p>
                        <p class="tips">Watch the sunset or the night light up the sky and truly appreciate every moment, it definately helps with getting yourself into a routine enjoying your own company or simply surrounded by loved ones and friends, make a coffee, have your water, even take some photos or listen to your favourite song.</p>
                        <p class="tips">A 20 minute walk a day will most definately help manage emotions and look more positively on life, this is also another method of practicing mindfulness and awareness. Think of 5 things you are grateful for and this essentially will allow you to control your thoughts of stress, anxiety, depression and feelings of overwhelming situations.

                    <h3>THOUGHTS</h3>
                        <p class="tips">Sometimes our thoughts are so crazy sometimes it stops us from being able to enjoy the fullest of life, this can be challenging especially if your battling your own thoughts,have alot going on right now and not feeling like you have anyone to turn too, just remember you are never alone.</p>
                        <p class="tips">To help control and manage thoughts, there is a technique called 'Grounding' this involves the use of breathing exercises combined with the senses to create better experiences around you, for example if we think of a lake we would experience the sound of water, maybe the sounds of birds, people walking and the wind on our back. We would close our eyes and imagine it like a picture to help calm thoughts and allow yourself to truly relax and maintain your focus and thoughts.</p>
                        <p class="tips"> Practicing grounding and even meditation techniques will allow you to not only grow as an individual but also be able to manage your thoughts and emotions by creating a safe space and your zen based around the senses increasing your focus.</p>

                    <h3>EMOTIONS</h3>
                        <p class="tips">Dealing with different emotions can sometimes be difficult to deal with at times, this can plauge our mind with many worries about the present, future and thinking of our past. A good way to manage emotions is to allow yourself time to process what you are feeling in the moment, this can be done by journaling what it is you are feeling, how you react to the feeling, what about the situation that's making you feel this way and what you would like to achieve which helps you focus on maintaining your thoughts better.</p>
                        <p class="tips">Another good way to manage your emotions is to meditate and practice a technique called 'Imagery' this will allow you to picture a safe place where you  feel comfortable by using the senses to focus and relax and allow you to feel calm and safe, this can be thinking of your favorite place like a beach or lake and picturing what it would be like in that moment to feel calm and comfortable.</p>

                    <h3>INSOMNIA</h3>
                        <p class="tips">Some people find it extremely difficult to fall asleep or even stay asleep, this is called insomnia and can really affect your mood and ability to focus. A great way of managing insomnia is through some herbal remidies such as Lavender and Marjoram oils on your pillow or even bubble bath and soaps as it calms the mind and body into feeling more sleepy.</p>
                        <p class="tips">Another good method is also reading and practicing meditation and mindfulness as sometimes when you're stressed this can cause difficulty sleeping, following a guided meditation at night will definately help you to relax into a deep sleep and be able to improve your mood and focus.</p>
